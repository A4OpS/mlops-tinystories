# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

### Week 1

* [ ] Create a git repository
* [ ] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
* [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
* [ ] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
* [ ] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
* [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
* [ ] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
* [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project

## Group information

### Question 1
> **Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk>**
>
> Answer:

Group 42

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Example:
>
> *sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX*
>
> Answer:

s194323, s194368, s183901, s183969, s194248

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We used the transformers package from the third-party framework huggingface. From this framework we used the pre-defined architectures for the language models. We can easily initialize a model with the same architecture as from the tiny stories paper and try to train it from scratch. This framework also allowed us to change some parameters in the achitecture like the number of layers, the vocabulary size and more. We specifically used the GPTNeoConfig to define the parameters of the model and passed this into the GPTNeoForCasualLM to initialize the model. These functionalities from the transformers package saved us a lot of time on getting a first model set up and working properly, giving us more time to focus on the Operations and training parts.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

In our GitHub repository we worked on different branches when implementing new features to the project. Each member would add dependies to requirements.txt and requirements_dev.txt. These two files are then used to keep track of dependencies needed for a production enviroment and dependencies for a development enviroment respectively. A new member to the team could then access the needed branch and install all dependencies in the two files. So after having created and activated a new enviroment to work in, a new team member could run the two following commands to get all needed dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

For this project we have used the suggested cookiecutter template. We have structured all code in the project under the assumption that the working directory should always be the root of the template, namely mlops-tinystories. In the mlopstinystories subfolder, we have put all python code to download and process data, define and initialize our model, train a model, make predictions for the model. The scripts that download and process the data save it in the mlops-tinystories/data folder in raw and processed subfolders.
We have added the conf folder we save configurations uses via the Hydra package and in the tests folder we have saved the python scripts to run unit-tests. We have not used the notebooks folder as we have not worked with jupyter notebooks.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

As part of continuous integration, we added a GitHub action that checks all commits to main via the ruff package. So if a team member tried to commit some python files that did not follow ruff rules, then their commits/pull requests to main would be failed and they would need to commit again once their scripts follow ruff rules.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

We have 24 unittests implemented these cover two aspects: the data and the model. We test when getting the raw data and if the data is processed correctly. For getting the raw data, we test if all relevant directories exist and have been created properly. We also test if all raw files actually contain some data. For processing the data we test if a dataloader is created and also test that it is not empty. The model is also testes, to ensure the input and output is the correct format, and if the model can calculate gradients. 


### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We used both brances and pull requests in our project. At the beginning of the project, an issue was made for all items seen on the project checklist. When a team member would start working on an issue they would create a new branch to work on. The issue would also be assigned to that team member to help us keep track of who works on what. When the issue/checklist item was done and working, then the team member would commit and create a pull request in order to merge that branch with the main branch. We set up a rule that one other team member has to review and accept that pull request before the merge is done. When and if the request was accepted and merged into main then the issue could also be closed.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**

>
> Answer:

We have x seperate files for our CI. The first one we included was ruff for every merge to main branch. To avoid introducing bugs into the main branch we also included the test should be passed before a merge to main.

Tried to do continues integration of docker containers using github actions and mangaed to write a DockerBuild.yaml file that integrate with github action to automatically build a docker image and push it to a dockerhub that can be accused thug: 
`docker pull andreasraaskovdtu/mlops-tinystories:6a9208c034d2188ff4d0a6157efef563e7805a73`  

Unfortunately the free compute at Github could not handle the CUDA container because lag of space.

Did we set it up in google cloud instead?


## Running code and tracking experiments

> Answer:

We used config files for our experiments, where we choose tohandled with hydra. The config file name was then included was a argparser. It worked the following way:
python train_model --config-name quick
where the different configs had a folder making it easier to log what experiments that had been performed.

>
> Answer:

--- question 15 fill here ---

We relatively quickly got docker containers running on CPU, however, we spend a lot of time on the CUDA docker container since each container was around 26 GB which made them hard to work with. In order to save download speed we made a bash script that first created a base container with all the projects dependencies, then we used the base container to create a train container that had access to the data set and the config files in order to rapidly train new models. We also created a deploy container that can run the model. 

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**
>

> Example:
> *Debugging method was dependent on group member. Some just used ... and others used ... . We did a single profiling*
> *run of our main code at some point that showed ...*
>
> Answer:

For debugging in this project...
A PyTorchProfiler was wrapped around our training loop to analyze if any optimization was needed. After inspecting the time spent on certain steps in the training, it was found that there was immediate need for any optimizations. Much of our code is setup by using different frameworks like lightning and transformers package from huggingface. Since most of our code relies on these well established frameworks, it does not come as a suprise that our was already somewhat optimized.
