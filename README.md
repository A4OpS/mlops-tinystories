# mlops-tinystories

## Project description

A replication parts of the [Tiny Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) paper.
We will use the original dataset from the paper, which can be found on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories), the dataset contains around 5000 stories generated by ChatGPT4 with the instructions of only useng the same vocabulary as a child would have. The paper uses a GPT Neo achetecture to make small languge models (less then a billion paremeters) that can be trained on a single GPU core. 
We will initially use the architectures from the paper, but may try out other things if we find interesting ideas.

### Open questions
 - What is meant by "incorporate some third-party framework"? Pytorch is a third-party framework. Does this count? What about the `transformers` library?
